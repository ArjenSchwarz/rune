# Rune Initial Version Requirements

## Introduction

Rune is a standalone Go command-line tool designed specifically for AI agents to create and manage hierarchical markdown task lists with consistent formatting. This initial version focuses on core MVP functionality including task CRUD operations, hierarchical data management, parsing/rendering, CLI interface, JSON API, query capabilities, and standardized file formatting.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Task Operations

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to perform CRUD operations on hierarchical task structures, so that I can programmatically manage complex project task lists without dealing with markdown parsing complexities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.1. The system SHALL create new task markdown files with predefined clean structure and formatting
1.2. The system SHALL parse existing task markdown files into structured data representations
1.3. The system SHALL update task status by toggling between pending `[ ]`, in-progress `[-]`, and completed `[x]` states
1.4. The system SHALL add new tasks and subtasks at any hierarchy level with automatic ID assignment
1.5. The system SHALL remove tasks and subtasks with automatic renumbering of subsequent tasks
1.6. The system SHALL modify task content including titles, details, and references independently
1.7. The system SHALL render tasks with consistent formatting and proper indentation regardless of input variations

### 2. Data Structure Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean data model for task representation, so that the tool can handle complex hierarchical relationships reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
2.1. The system SHALL implement a TaskList struct containing title and root-level tasks
2.2. The system SHALL implement a Task struct with ID, title, status, details, references, and children fields
2.3. The system SHALL use hierarchical string IDs (e.g., "1", "1.1", "1.2.1") for task identification
2.4. The system SHALL support three task states: Pending, InProgress, and Completed
2.5. The system SHALL maintain parent-child relationships in the task hierarchy
2.6. The system SHALL automatically manage ID renumbering when tasks are added or removed

### 3. Parsing and Rendering

**User Story:** As a user working with various markdown task formats, I want consistent output regardless of input format variations, so that all task files follow the same standard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
3.1. The parser SHALL process markdown line-by-line to build task hierarchies
3.2. The parser SHALL use indentation levels to determine task hierarchy relationships
3.3. The parser SHALL extract task titles, status, details, and references from various markdown formats
3.4. The renderer SHALL always produce identical formatting for equivalent task structures
3.5. The renderer SHALL use 2-space indentation per hierarchy level
3.6. The renderer SHALL format details as bullet points with consistent spacing
3.7. The renderer SHALL format references with "References: " prefix and comma-separated values
3.8. The system SHALL support round-trip operations (parse → render → parse) without data loss

### 4. Command-Line Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive CLI for task management operations, so that I can interact with task files through simple commands.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
4.1. The CLI SHALL be implemented using the Cobra framework for consistent command structure
4.2. The CLI SHALL provide a `create` command to generate new task files with specified titles
4.3. The CLI SHALL provide a `list` command to display tasks in various formats (table, markdown, JSON)
4.4. The CLI SHALL provide an `add` command to insert new tasks with optional parent specification
4.5. The CLI SHALL provide `complete` and `uncomplete` commands for status management
4.6. The CLI SHALL provide an `update` command to modify task titles, details, and references
4.7. The CLI SHALL provide a `remove` command to delete tasks with automatic renumbering
4.8. The CLI SHALL provide a `batch` command to process multiple operations from JSON input
4.9. The CLI SHALL support dry-run mode for previewing changes before applying them

### 5. JSON API Integration

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want a structured JSON API for batch operations, so that I can perform complex task manipulations efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
5.1. The system SHALL accept JSON input for all operations with clear schema validation
5.2. The system SHALL return JSON output for all operations with structured error reporting
5.3. The system SHALL support batch operations combining multiple mutations in single transactions
5.4. The system SHALL provide comprehensive error messages for invalid operations
5.5. The system SHALL validate operation parameters before applying any changes
5.6. The system SHALL support dry-run mode for batch operations

### 6. Query and Search Capabilities

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to query and search tasks efficiently, so that I can find specific tasks without parsing entire file contents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
6.1. The system SHALL provide a `find` command to search tasks by title content
6.2. The system SHALL support filtering tasks by status (pending, in-progress, completed)
6.3. The system SHALL support filtering tasks by hierarchy level (top-level, specific depth)
6.4. The system SHALL provide JSON output for search results to enable programmatic processing
6.5. The system SHALL support searching within task details and references
6.6. The system SHALL return hierarchical context (parent tasks) for search results
6.7. The system SHALL support case-insensitive search by default with case-sensitive option

### 7. File Format Standardization

**User Story:** As a user collaborating on projects, I want consistent file formats, so that task files are readable and maintainable across different tools and team members.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
7.1. The system SHALL generate consistent markdown structure with title headers
7.2. The system SHALL use standardized checkbox syntax (`[ ]` for pending, `[-]` for in-progress, `[x]` for completed)
7.3. The system SHALL maintain hierarchical numbering (1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1)
7.4. The system SHALL format task details with consistent bullet point indentation
7.5. The system SHALL group references in a standardized format
7.6. The system SHALL preserve empty lines and section breaks appropriately
7.7. The system SHALL normalize input files to the standard format upon first processing
