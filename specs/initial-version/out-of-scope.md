# Rune Initial Version - Out of Scope Requirements

These requirements are deferred to future versions to keep the initial implementation focused on core MVP functionality.

## 6. Output Format Support (Deferred to Phase 2)

**User Story:** As a user, I want multiple output formats for different use cases, so that I can integrate task data with various tools and workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
6.1. The system SHALL support markdown output as the primary format
6.2. The system SHALL support JSON output for programmatic access
6.3. The system SHALL integrate with go-output/v2 for table-formatted status displays
6.4. The system SHALL provide filtering options for displaying tasks by status
6.5. The system SHALL support progress visualization and statistics reporting
6.6. The system SHALL generate version-control friendly output with minimal diffs

## 7. Performance and Reliability (Deferred to Phase 2)

**User Story:** As a user working with large task files, I want fast and reliable operations, so that the tool remains responsive with complex project structures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
7.1. The system SHALL respond within 1 second for files containing up to 100 tasks
7.2. The system SHALL handle internal concurrent operations safely within a single process
7.3. The system SHALL validate all input parameters before processing
7.4. The system SHALL preserve data integrity during all mutation operations
7.5. The system SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid operations
7.6. The system SHALL support operation idempotency for repeated API calls

## 9. File Format Flexibility (Deferred to Phase 2)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to work with task files regardless of their extension, so that I can manage tasks in any plain-text file format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
9.1. The system SHALL accept any plain-text file regardless of file extension
9.2. The system SHALL validate file contents to ensure they contain task-like structure
9.3. The system SHALL process files based on content structure rather than file extension
9.4. The system SHALL handle files without extensions appropriately

## 10. Data Integrity and Correction (Deferred to Phase 2)

**User Story:** As a user working with manually edited files, I want automatic correction of ID inconsistencies, so that the tool can handle files that may have been modified outside the tool.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
10.1. The parser SHALL automatically correct duplicate task IDs by renumbering conflicting tasks
10.2. The parser SHALL automatically correct invalid or missing IDs in the hierarchy
10.3. The system SHALL maintain correct parent-child relationships when auto-correcting IDs
10.4. The system SHALL log corrections made during parsing for user awareness
10.5. The system SHALL ensure renumbered IDs follow the hierarchical numbering scheme

## Future Enhancements to Consider

- Advanced batch operation features with rollback support
- Dry-run mode for all operations
- Performance optimizations for large files (1000+ tasks)
- Multi-process file locking and concurrent access
- Plugin architecture for custom transformations
- Integration with external tools and APIs
- Advanced query language for complex searches
- Task metadata and custom field support
- Backup and recovery mechanisms
- Import/export from other task management formats
