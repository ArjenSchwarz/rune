# Task Requirements Linking Feature Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds the ability to link tasks to specific requirement acceptance criteria in a requirements file. This supports spec-driven development by making it easy to trace which tasks implement which requirements. The linking uses markdown links pointing to anchors in the requirements file, similar to how the existing References field works but with automatic link generation.

## Requirements

### 1. Requirements Field Support in Task Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tasks to have a requirements field that links to acceptance criteria, so that I can trace implementation to requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="1.1"></a>The system SHALL add a Requirements field to the Task struct to store requirement links
2. <a name="1.2"></a>The Requirements field SHALL store an array of strings representing requirement IDs (e.g., "1.1", "1.2", "2.3")
3. <a name="1.3"></a>The Requirements field SHALL be optional and may be empty
4. <a name="1.4"></a>The system SHALL preserve the existing References field without modification
5. <a name="1.5"></a>The Requirements field SHALL support hierarchical requirement IDs matching the pattern `^\d+(\.\d+)*$`

### 2. Requirements Rendering in Markdown Output

**User Story:** As a user, I want requirements displayed as clickable markdown links, so that I can navigate directly to requirement acceptance criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="2.1"></a>The system SHALL render requirements as markdown links in the format `[ID](file#ID)`
2. <a name="2.2"></a>The system SHALL format multiple requirements as comma-separated links
3. <a name="2.3"></a>The system SHALL render requirements with consistent markdown formatting matching existing task detail lines (italic prefix, proper indentation, positioned before References)

### 3. Requirements File Path Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify which requirements file to link to, so that I can support different project structures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="3.1"></a>The `add` command SHALL accept a `--requirements-file` parameter to specify the requirements file path
2. <a name="3.2"></a>The system SHALL default to "requirements.md" when no requirements file is specified

### 4. Requirements Parsing from Markdown

**User Story:** As a user, I want the parser to extract requirements from task markdown, so that existing files with requirements can be read.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="4.1"></a>The system SHALL parse lines starting with `*Requirements: ` or `Requirements: ` to extract requirement links
2. <a name="4.2"></a>The system SHALL extract requirement IDs from markdown link syntax `[ID](path#ID)`
3. <a name="4.3"></a>The system SHALL handle multiple comma-separated requirement links on a single line
4. <a name="4.4"></a>The system SHALL treat malformed requirement lines as plain text details and continue parsing
5. <a name="4.5"></a>The system SHALL preserve requirements during round-trip parsing and rendering

### 5. Adding Requirements via CLI

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add requirements when adding or updating tasks, so that I can link tasks to acceptance criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="5.1"></a>The `add` command SHALL support a `--requirements` flag accepting comma-separated requirement IDs
2. <a name="5.2"></a>The `add` command SHALL support a `--requirements-file` flag to set or override the requirements file path
3. <a name="5.3"></a>The `update` command SHALL support a `--requirements` flag to replace task requirements
4. <a name="5.4"></a>The system SHALL validate requirement ID format matches `^\d+(\.\d+)*$` pattern
5. <a name="5.5"></a>The system SHALL not validate that requirement IDs actually exist in the requirements file
6. <a name="5.6"></a>The system SHALL support clearing requirements by passing an empty string to `--requirements`

### 6. Batch Command Support for Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add requirements in batch operations, so that I can efficiently manage task-requirement links programmatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="6.1"></a>The batch JSON format SHALL support an optional "requirements_file" field to specify the requirements file path
2. <a name="6.2"></a>The "requirements_file" field SHALL default to "requirements.md" when not specified
3. <a name="6.3"></a>The batch JSON format SHALL support a "requirements" field in add and update operations
4. <a name="6.4"></a>The "requirements" field SHALL accept an array of requirement ID strings
5. <a name="6.5"></a>The system SHALL validate requirement ID format for each ID in the batch operation

### 7. JSON API Support for Requirements

**User Story:** As an API user, I want to access requirements information via JSON output, so that I can programmatically query task-requirement links.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="7.1"></a>The JSON output SHALL include a "requirements" field containing an array of requirement ID strings
2. <a name="7.2"></a>The JSON output SHALL include a "requirements_file" field in the TaskList metadata when set

### 8. Documentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation for the requirements linking feature, so that I understand how to use it effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. <a name="8.1"></a>The README.md SHALL be updated to document the Requirements field and how it differs from References
2. <a name="8.2"></a>The README.md SHALL include examples showing how to add requirements using the `--requirements` flag
3. <a name="8.3"></a>The README.md SHALL document the `--requirements-file` flag and its default behavior
4. <a name="8.4"></a>The docs/json-api.md SHALL be updated to document the "requirements" and "requirements_file" fields in the JSON format
5. <a name="8.5"></a>The documentation SHALL include examples of the rendered markdown format for requirements links
