  - Automatic backup creation with `.bak` extension before operations
  - Phase marker preservation with automatic `AfterTaskID` adjustment
  - YAML front matter preservation during renumbering
  - Atomic file write operations for data safety
  - Supports table, markdown, and JSON output formats

  - Version resolution with "latest" or specific version support
  - Automatic caching using GitHub Actions tool-cache
  - MD5 checksum verification for integrity
  - Outputs for version and installation path

### Changed

- **Test Suite Modernization**: Refactored to follow Go 2025 best practices
  - Converted slice-based table tests to map-based for better isolation
  - Split monolithic integration test file into focused test files by feature
  - Improved test maintainability and clarity

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Task Requirements Linking**: Link tasks to requirement acceptance criteria
  - `--requirements` flag on `add` and `update` commands for comma-separated requirement IDs
  - `--requirements-file` flag to specify requirements document (defaults to "requirements.md")
  - `--clear-requirements` flag to remove all requirements from a task
  - Requirements rendered as markdown links `[ID](file#ID)` in task output
  - Full batch operation support with requirements validation
  - Round-trip preservation in parse-render cycles

- **Task Phases**: Organize tasks under semantic H2 markdown headers
  - `add-phase` command to add phase headers to task files
  - `--phase` flag on `add` and `next` commands
  - `has-phases` command for programmatic phase detection
  - Phase information displayed in all output formats

- **Front Matter Support**: YAML front matter for metadata and references
  - `--reference` and `--meta` flags on `create` command
  - `add-frontmatter` command for existing files
  - References displayed in all output formats

- **Git Branch Discovery**: Automatic task file location based on git branch
  - Default `{branch}/tasks.md` pattern
  - Configuration via `.rune.yml` or `~/.config/rune/config.yml`

- **Next Task Workflow**: Sequential task management
  - `next` command finds first incomplete task via depth-first traversal
  - Task details and references in output

- **Auto-completion**: Parent tasks complete when all children are done
  - Recursive hierarchy checking
  - Visual feedback with 🎯 emoji

- **Position-based Insertion**: `--position` flag for precise task placement
  - Automatic ID renumbering

- **Core Task Management**: Complete CLI for hierarchical markdown task lists
  - CRUD operations: `create`, `add`, `update`, `remove`
  - Status management: `complete`, `progress`, `uncomplete`
  - Query operations: `list`, `find`
  - Batch operations: atomic multi-operation execution

### Changed

- Improved code organization with consolidated helper functions
- Refactored test suites into focused files by functionality
- Simplified ID validation and task parsing logic

### Security

- File size limit (10MB)
- Path traversal protection
- Input sanitization for null bytes and control characters
- Resource limits (10,000 tasks max, 10 levels deep, 1,000 char details)
- Branch name sanitization
